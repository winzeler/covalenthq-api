# CovalentHQ API

Created as part of a SF ETHGlobal hackathon project.

## Introduction

The Covalent Unified API can be used to pull balances, positions and historical granular transaction data from dozens of blockchain networks. This data enables hundreds of end-user use-cases like wallets, investor dashboards, taxation tools and as-of-yet unknown use-cases.

One Unified API. One Billion Possibilities.
